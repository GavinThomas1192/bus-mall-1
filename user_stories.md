As the Marketing research team: We want to set up a survey testing possible products
for bus riders to be able to purchase from our online store. We want to narrow down our products based on the number of hits on our pre-selected items.  We want the focus group to be shown 3 items at random, 25 separate times then have a place for the participant to review their selections.


As the Developer: We want to set up a front facing page that the user group can access to take the product survey. We need to  set up the logic to show 3 product images with an attached event listener to listen for a click on the image the user likes and tally that click. We want to randomize each image without repetition in a single row and avoid repetition in the following instance.  We want to make sure and give detailed instructions on how to take the survey. On the JS page, we need to make the event handler, we need to randomize the product images, we need to tally the clicks of each chosen product, we need to calculate how many times each image is displayed vs how many times clicked to get an accurate account of popularity. On the css page we need to make sure the layout and each product image is clear and concise for the user to be able to select accordingly.


As the Focus group participant: We want easy and precise instructions on how to complete the survey, clear images of the products, and be able to see our results at the end of the survey.
